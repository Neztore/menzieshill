                Menzieshill Whitehall was formed in January 2003 after the merger of one of the oldest and youngest swimming clubs in Dundee.
                <br>
                Whitehall Amateur Swimming Club was formed in 1887 by two solicitors, Wm Kidd and James McKay. They conducted their business from an office in Whitehall Street – hence the name of the Club.
                <br>
                Whitehall Amateur Swimming Club was formed before Scottish Swimming, which wasn't formed until January 28th 1888.
                <br><br>
                Menzieshill Swimming & Water polo Club was formed within Menzieshill High School by Frank Jordan, a member of the PE staff, in the 1970's.
                <br>
                In 1972 Frank Jordan formed a small swimming & water polo team at Menzieshill HS. The school squad took part in their first training session in April 1972. By the end of the summer 1973 many of the pupils were keen to be part of the team. As the numbers kept increasing the team took part in local inter-school competitions and friendly galas.
                <br>
                In 1974 Menzieshill HS swim team began winning titles at District & National School events, setting the long standing record of winning all four Midland School Swimming Championships.
                <br>
                Between 1975-1982, Menzieshill challenged school and club teams all over Britain, winning Scottish, District and local championships. They set up another record by having a relay team in every final at the Scottish Schools Swimming Championships in 1977.The greatest achievement in swimming as a school team has got to be the setting up of World Record for the 100 Mile Marathon Relay Swim on three seperate occasions - 1974/1977/1980. In 1977 the time set was 27hrs , by 1980 the team had it down to 22hrs 8mins, manitaining their place in the Guinness Book of World Records. They STILL hold the record for a school squad at this event, and photographs of the three World Records Teams hang in the world famous Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
                <br><br>
                The club affiliated to the SASA (Midland District) in 1983. Frank is Honorary President of the club and came out of retirement to act as President in the absence of the club having one for 2009 and 2010.
                <br>
                Throughout the years the club has had various international swimmers and water polo players and gained many honours at various levels in, swimming, water polo and open water swimming.
                <br><br>
                Between the years 1966-68 Frank was a Scottish Senior Polo Coach, Mens National Polo Coach. 1980-94 Frank was Senior National Womens Coach. 1979-80 he was the Scottish Age Group Swim Coach and Dundee Schools Swim Coach.
                <br>

                <br>
                Menzieshill junior boys water polo teams won the Scottish Cup 1988,89 & 90, and the senior men won 1st Div from 1984-87.
                <br>

                <br><br>
                Frank was the founder member of ladies water polo. After the successful trip to Malta,on his return, Frank got in touch with Perth, Dunfermline, Portobello and formed a league. From that league it then became the Scottish cup, which is still played to this day.
                <br>
                Many swimmers have competed at the top level with Billy McGoldrick, winning a Bronze Medal at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Australia.. Robert Sreenan was an Olympian who also played water polo and still is the record holder for the double Tay open water swim.
